DX11FrameLib
============

Basic DirectX 11 rendering framework in a static library.

The goal of this project is to see how much code I could "hide" inside a static library.
The idea came from discovering I could put WinMain in a static library.
Executable should only need to implement one class (CApp) that the lib will instantiate.
